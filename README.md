# Savor
Save and Donate

Porblem Statement -
According to statistics around 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted annually. Which is one third of human food consumption. Huge amounts of food is also lost simply because we throw it away. 35% of the wasted food is simply thrown out by supermarkets, shops, and households. If this trends keeps on increasing then soon their will be shortage of food. There is more than enough food produced in the world to feed everyone on the planet. Yet as many as 828 million people still go hungry. So we are making a web application to resolve this issue.

Solution of the Problem developed by our team-
Our project is Savor that means to Save and donate. In this web application a user can add a food item or a medicine with its expiry date. When the expiry date is near it will notifies the user which saves to food from wastage. If a user do not want to consume the food or medicine then user can donate that item for free or with some amount of money so that the item can be used by someone in need or can be send to an NGO. This will help in reducing food wastage.
